## To build from source 

### Requirements
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)
  
  if you are on linux you can download the following package from the package manager
          
    on Debain based Distro 
     
          sudo apt install libsfml-dev cmake -y
          
    on Arch or arch based Distros
          
          sudo pacman -S libsfml-dev cmake
          
  
 ### Steps 
  
 - You can download the zip file or shallow clone the project.
 - After inside cd into the folder and run
 

Using CMake CLI

        mkdir build; cd build; cmake -G "Your Target Generator" ..
 look for how to choose generators ![here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-generators.7.html) 
 
 Using Cmake GUI
 
        cmake-gui
        
If you are on windows then, CMake may not find path to sfml directory; you may explicitly define it by using -D option 

        cmake -DSFML_DIR=Your path here -G "Target generator" ..
        
 or use CMake GUI. everything seems easier there. 
 
 After generating the build files you can run respective makefiles and generate the executable.
